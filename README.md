### What is AoC?
Advent of Code (Aoc) is a yearly event since 2015, starting on December 1 all the way upto advent, December 25.

There is a story which is being followed, generally an issue with the elves and santa, and you are trying to solve the problems programmatically.

Each day there is a problem released and a little bit more about the story. The problem consists of two parts. The first part is unlocked at 05:00 GMT, and the second part is unlocked once you solved the first part.  
Generally, first part can be solved by brute-force but the second part may take some thinking, or coming up with an alternate or better approach.

The problems consist of various mathematical, data-structure or algorithmic problem.

After solving each problem, it reveals a part of the ASCII art on the webpage.

Your puzzle input will be a `.txt` file, which you need to parse through and convert it for your use. Each solution is unique to each player, IE: no two players will get the same puzzle input, so you cannot copy someone else's answer.

### Why do it?
Aoc is a great opportunity to learn a new programming language, or enhance your knowledge on data-structures and explore more of the programming language of your choice.
